As someone who recently joined the University of Washington, I have made an observation.  There are many old and seldomly used Ocean Optics spectroradiometers around, but all of the licenses for the OO software are difficult to locate.  I started looking for a way to run the spectroradiometer without the OO software license, and I found [this repository](https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze).  As I am just getting the hang of GitHub, I am not sure of the best way to acknowledge this work - I believe forking it gives credit, but I will have to learn how to do this.  Regardless, Andreas Poehlmann has my sincere appreciation!
